    The rules, as tweeted by
    <a href='https://twitter.com/eurovisiondrink'>@eurovisiondrink</a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    The grand traditions laid down by Terry Wogan and Graham Norton mean we
    drink whilst watching the Eurovision Song Contest.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you like a little competitiveness around it, then here is our list.
    When anything in this list happens, we all drink.
  </p>

  <h3>Going to print these out?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong class='start'>Don't bother.</strong> You don't need to
    remember the list. Which is handy because if you play along, towards
    the end of the night you'll be unable to. Just follow
    <a href='https://twitter.com/eurovisiondrink'>@eurovisiondrink</a>
    on Twitter. Every time something happens, you'll see what to do in
    your timeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class='start'>Level up!</strong> If you use the Twitter mobile
    app, turn on notifications from the
    <a href='https://twitter.com/eurovisiondrink'>@eurovisiondrink</a>
    profile. Now every time something happens, you'll get binged. (This
    will happen <strong>a lot</strong> throughout the night and probably
    prove to be annoying, so this is really only for the hardest of
    cores.)
  </p>
  <p>
    But if you must have it on paper, just hit print now, and this webpage
    should comfortably fit on one sheet. No need to copy and paste.

    &mdash; for your real-time booze notifications. Boozifications.

<h3>Remember to drink responsiblyâ€¦</h3>
<ul id='responsibly'>
  <li>Always refresh the glass of your guests before your own.</li>
  <li>Always have copious snacks available.</li>
  <li>
    A true Eurovision Drinking Game fan knows to stay hydrated,
    and to pace themselves. Nobody likes a sloppy drunk.
  </li>
  <li>No belching.</li>
</ul>
