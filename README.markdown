[@eurovisiondrink](https://twitter.com/eurovisiondrink) is a
semi-automated twitter account for those of us who enjoy drinking
during the Eurovision Song Contest. When certain incidents happen
during the broadcast, a tweet is sent explaining what has just
happened and how much you should drink.

To speed up this tweeting, most of it happens from a control panel, 
so I can get back to enjoying Eurovision as quickly as possible.

This repo is that control panel, and the source for the website 
[http://eurovisiondrinking.com](http://eurovisiondrinking.com).
